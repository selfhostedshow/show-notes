  * [FSF and GNU](https://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-and-gnu "FSF and GNU") — GNU decision-making has largely been in the hands of GNU leadership. Since RMS resigned as president of the FSF, but not as head of GNU ("Chief GNUisance"), the FSF is now working with GNU leadership on a shared understanding of the relationship for the future.
  * [Joint statement on the GNU Project](https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2019/joint-statement-on-the-gnu-project/ "Joint statement on the GNU Project") — Yet, we must also acknowledge that Stallman’s behavior over the years has undermined a core value of the GNU project: the empowerment of all computer users. GNU is not fulfilling its mission when the behavior of its leader alienates a large part of those we want to reach out to.
  * [No radical changes in GNU Project](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2019-10/msg00005.html "No radical changes in GNU Project") — As Chief GNUisance, I'd like to reassure the community that there won't be any radical changes in the GNU Project's goals, principles and policies.

  * [AMP is joining the OpenJS Foundation incubation program](https://blog.amp.dev/2019/10/10/amp-is-joining-the-openjs-foundation-incubation-program/ "AMP is joining the OpenJS Foundation incubation program") — After considering many options for a foundation that meets all of AMP’s needs, the OpenJS Foundation stood out as an ideal home for AMP.
  * [Google Stadia will be “faster and more responsive” than local gaming hardware](https://www.pcgamesn.com/stadia/negative-latency-prediction "Google Stadia will be “faster and more responsive” than local gaming hardware") — Thanks to some precog trickery, Google believes its streaming system will be faster than the gaming systems of the near-future, no matter how powerful they may become.
