  * [Android 13 is in AOSP](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2022/08/android-13-is-in-aosp.html "Android 13 is in AOSP") — Today we’re pushing the Android 13 source to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and officially releasing the newest version of Android.
  * [Android 13 Sources Released To AOSP](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Android-13-AOSP "Android 13 Sources Released To AOSP")
  * [Glibc 2.36 Dropping DT_HASH Has Been Breaking Easy Anti Cheat Games](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Glibc-2.36-EAC-Problems "Glibc 2.36 Dropping DT_HASH Has Been Breaking Easy Anti Cheat Games") — The breakage stems from the DT_HASH section being dropped in GNU C Library but EAC being among the few software still expecting that section rather than DT_GNU_HASH.
  * [Pierre-Loup Griffais on Twitter](https://twitter.com/plagman2/status/1559683905904463873 "Pierre-Loup Griffais on Twitter") — Unfortunate that upstream glibc discussion on DT_HASH isn't coming out strongly in favor of prioritizing compatibility with pre-existing applications. Every such instance contributes to damaging the idea of desktop Linux as a viable target for third-party developers.
  * [Carlos O’Donell on Twitter](https://twitter.com/CarlosODonell/status/1556742747419181060 "Carlos O’Donell on Twitter") — How far should Linux ELF follow the generic ELF standard (gABI)? We recently let distributions drop DT_HASH from glibc builds (mandatory under the gABI). This broke EPIC's Easy Anti-Cheat. We *should* ask the gABI for DT_HASH to be optional.
  * [GLIBC update broke EAC for most games that use it](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6051 "GLIBC update broke EAC for most games that use it") — Issue #6051 · ValveSoftware/Proton
  * [Should we make DT_HASH dynamic section for glibc?](https://sourceware.org/pipermail/libc-alpha/2022-August/141304.html "Should we make DT_HASH dynamic section for glibc?")
  * [gapi discussion: Making DT_HASH optional?](https://groups.google.com/g/generic-abi/c/th5919osPAQ?pli=1 "gapi discussion: Making DT_HASH optional?")
  * [Linux 6.0 debuts, missing some Rusty bits](https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/15/linux_60_debuts_missing_some/ "Linux 6.0 debuts, missing some Rusty bits") — Emperor Penguin Linus Torvalds has released the first release candidate for Linux 6.0, but doesn't mind what you call it.
  * [Linux 6.0 arrives with performance improvements and more Rust coming](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-6-0-arrives-with-performance-improvements-and-more-rust-coming/ "Linux 6.0 arrives with performance improvements and more Rust coming")
  * [Linux 6.0-rc1 Released With Exciting Performance Optimizations](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.0-rc1-Released "Linux 6.0-rc1 Released With Exciting Performance Optimizations")
  * [Real-Time “PREEMPT_RT” Not in 6.0-rc1](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.0-RT-Patches "Real-Time “PREEMPT_RT” Not in 6.0-rc1") — Of the 50 patches, it's not too bad either as there are five patches for example that are rather trivial for just enabling real-time (RT) support in the Kconfig files for ARM / ARM64 / POWER / x86 / x86_64. There are also a handful of patches each specific to POWER and the i915 graphics driver code.
  * [Debian turns 29!](https://bits.debian.org/2022/08/debian-turns-29.html "Debian turns 29!") — Today is Debian's 29th anniversary. We recently wrote about some ideas to celebrate DebianDay, and several events have been planned in more than 14 locations.

  * [mu on Twitter](https://ni.hil.ist/@mu/108824144772569843 "mu on Twitter") — Sick Codes has jailbroken a John Deere, and this is just the beginning. Turns out our entire food system is built on outdated, unpatched Linux and Windows CE hardware with LTE modems.
  * [How a version of Doom running on a John Deere tractor champions the right-to-repair movement](https://www.xda-developers.com/john-deere-right-to-repair-movement/ "How a version of Doom running on a John Deere tractor champions the right-to-repair movement") — Sick Codes achieved this by working with different tractor control touchscreen consoles, narrowing it down to a select few models, and finding a way to exploit these devices.
