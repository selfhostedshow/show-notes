  * [Element Call Beta 2 includes lots of exciting new updates!](https://element.io/blog/element-call-beta-2-encryption-spatial-audio-walkie-talkie-mode-and-more/ "Element Call Beta 2 includes lots of exciting new updates!") — In a walkie-talkie call, videos are disabled, and everyone is muted by default. To speak, press the ‘push-to-talk’ (PTT) button, either by pressing it on the screen or by holding the spacebar. The catch is that, just like a walkie-talkie or two-way radio, only one person can speak at a time. When someone else is speaking, your PTT button will be disabled, and if you try to push it you’ll hear a warning beep. 
  * [Fedora and Ubuntu EOL announcements](https://lwn.net/Articles/896804/ "Fedora and Ubuntu EOL announcements") — If you are running Fedora 34, the time has come to move on; that distribution will reach the end of its support life on June 7. Users of Ubuntu 21.10 have a little longer, but that release loses support on July 14 and users should update to 22.04.

  * [Hector Martin on Twitter](https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1534030476264218624 "Hector Martin on Twitter") — “Huh, so Rosetta is now a Linux app. Without Linux kernel patches this can’t use any special M1 features, so if this runs significantly better than FOSS offerings that should help dispel the myth that “the M1 has magic make-Rosetta-fast features”. 
  * [Longhorn on Twitter](https://twitter.com/never_released/status/1534127641082593281 "Longhorn on Twitter") — Well. Rosetta 2 needs a quite recent CPU (post v8.2) to work because of the instructions used. Does it work on non-Apple arm64 CPUs? 🤔 Yes. (allows to settle the argument once and for all that this needs anything Apple specific outside of TSO support*. Answer is a no.)
