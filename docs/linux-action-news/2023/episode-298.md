  * [Linux 6.4 Released, focus on 6.5](https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/26/linux_kernel_6_4_released/ "Linux 6.4 Released, focus on 6.5") — Linus Torvalds on Sunday announced the release without making any comment at all on the state of the kernel, or the efforts that led to the release of this version. Indeed, he had little to say about the progress of version 6.4

  * [Early access to the LXD graphical user interface](https://ubuntu.com//blog/lxd_ui "Early access to the LXD graphical user interface") — While we don’t yet advise you to use the LXD UI in a production setting, we made it available as an experimental feature and would like to invite you to take it out for a spin and share your feedback.

  * [Google Pixel 8 could debut Desktop Mode](https://www.androidtrends.com/google-pixel-8-could-debut-desktop-mode/ "Google Pixel 8 could debut Desktop Mode") — The Pixel 8 series is expected to leverage DisplayPort alternate mode, although specific details are not yet available. Through code analysis, it is possible to speculate on Google’s intentions for this feature. One obvious use would be to transform a Pixel 8 phone into a desktop replacement.

  * [Valve Contracts Another Prominent Open-Source Linux Graphics Driver Developer](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Valve-Another-Linux-GPU-Dev-23 "Valve Contracts Another Prominent Open-Source Linux Graphics Driver Developer") — Great to hear and given her vast experience will be exciting to see what open-source improvements she manages to further advance Linux gaming.
  * [Red Hat’s commitment to open source: A response to the git.centos.org changes](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hats-commitment-open-source-response-gitcentosorg-changes "Red Hat’s commitment to open source: A response to the git.centos.org changes") — Ultimately, we do not find value in a RHEL rebuild and we are not under any obligation to make things easier for rebuilders; this is our call to make. That brings me to CentOS Stream, of which there is immense confusion. I acknowledge that this is a change in a longstanding tradition where we went above and beyond, and change like this can cause some confusion.

That said, the business model as described by IBM's Red Hat may well comply with the GPL — it's just so murky that any tweak to the model in any direction seems to definitely violate, in our experience.
