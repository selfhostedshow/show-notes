We’re actually running on a Linux operating system. The software framework that we’re using is one that we developed at JPL for cubesats and instruments, and we open-sourced it a few years ago.

  * [Linux 5.12 Git Seeing New Code Land Following Winter Storm](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-Git-Activity-Resumes "Linux 5.12 Git Seeing New Code Land Following Winter Storm") — While the first week of a new merge window is often one of the busiest times for Linus Torvalds in overseeing the Linux kernel, until last night there was no actual Linux 5.12 code being pushed into the Linux Git repository. Linus was offline most of the week due to winter storms preventing him from pushing to the Git repository and interacting much with the mailing list.

Simply put, different mounts can expose the same file or directory with different ownership.

This still has some hacks in it that need to be fixed, so don't expect support for this in the tree right now. But a big thank you to those that contributed to the pool for getting us some hardware.
