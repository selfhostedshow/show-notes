  * [Rails 7.0: Fulfilling a vision](https://rubyonrails.org/2021/12/15/Rails-7-fulfilling-a-vision "Rails 7.0: Fulfilling a vision") — This vision wasn’t possible even just a few years ago. We simply didn’t have the core technologies in place.
  * [The One Person Framework](https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-one-person-framework-711e6318 "The One Person Framework") — The part that really excites me about this version, though, is how much closer it brings us to the ideal of The One Person Framework. A toolkit so powerful that it allows a single individual to create modern applications upon which they might build a competitive business. The way it used to be.
