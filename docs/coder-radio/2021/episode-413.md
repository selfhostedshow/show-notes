Apple’s lawyer says "Apple did not establish the 30 percent,” but rather game companies did back around 2003 when digital distrbuition was starting. “30% was, as Epic’s integrate documents will show, industry standard."
  * [Ben Bajarin on Twitter](https://twitter.com/benbajarin/status/1389252381666279425 "Ben Bajarin on Twitter") — Basically, they want to argue that macOS being more "open" yet still employing strong security and privacy stands in contrast to their argument about the policies on iPhone and iOS app store.
