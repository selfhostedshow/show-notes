Reducing the web to just another closed platform, like Windows or iOS, is to be blind to its truly unique shape and promise. Let’s cherish what made the web special, not pave it over.
  * [DHH on Twitter (2)](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1089305683164487682 "DHH on Twitter \(2\)") — Web Assembly is exciting in a lot of ways. This isn’t one of them. Hopefully we’ll keep HTML/CSS/JS readable, tinkerable, teachable for all the work that doesn’t need Web Assembly.
