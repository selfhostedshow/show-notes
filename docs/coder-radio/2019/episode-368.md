  * [Feedback: Which Language To Use And Why?](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoderRadio/comments/cgwcei/thanks_guys/ "Feedback: Which Language To Use And Why?") — There are so many languages out there, and I just don’t understand when or why you would want to use a language over another.
  * [Mathematician Solves Computer Science Conjecture in Two Pages | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-solves-computer-science-conjecture-in-two-pages-20190725/ "Mathematician Solves Computer Science Conjecture in Two Pages | Quanta Magazine") — This “sensitivity” conjecture has stumped many of the most prominent computer scientists over the years, yet the new proof is so simple that one researcher summed it up in a single tweet.
  * [ELI5: The Sensitivity Conjecture has been solved. What is it about?](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/ci0q00/eli5_the_sensitivity_conjecture_has_been_solved/ "ELI5: The Sensitivity Conjecture has been solved. What is it about?") — Think of it like a Buzzfeed quiz. You answer a bunch of multiple-choice input questions about seemingly random topics ('What's your favourite breakfast cereal?', 'What's your favourite classic movie?', 'What did you want to be when you grew up?', and so on), and you get a response back at the end: usually which Hogwarts house you belong in.
  * [Sensitivity Conjecture resolved](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4229 "Sensitivity Conjecture resolved") — Paul Erdös famously spoke of a book, maintained by God, in which was written the simplest, most beautiful proof of each theorem. The highest compliment Erdös could give a proof was that it “came straight from the book.” In this case, I find it hard to imagine that even God knows how to prove the Sensitivity Conjecture in any simpler way than this.
  * [arXiv: Induced subgraphs of hypercubes and a proof of the Sensitivity Conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00847 "arXiv: Induced subgraphs of hypercubes and a proof of the Sensitivity Conjecture")
  * [GitHub starts blocking developers in countries facing US trade sanctions](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-starts-blocking-developers-in-countries-facing-us-trade-sanctions/ "GitHub starts blocking developers in countries facing US trade sanctions") — There's a debate over free speech taking place after Microsoft-owned GitHub "restricted" the account of a developer based in the Crimea region of Ukraine, who used the service to host his website and gaming software. 
  * [GitHub blocked my account and they think I’m developing nuclear weapons](https://medium.com/@hamed/github-blocked-my-account-and-they-think-im-developing-nuclear-weapons-e7e1fe62cb74 "GitHub blocked my account and they think I’m developing nuclear weapons")
  * [1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us: Github do not ban us from open source world](https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us "1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us: Github do not ban us from open source world") — GitHub restricted our access to private repositories suddenly, but at the very least we wanted GitHub to warn us before limiting our access. 
  * [A Rust-based TLS library outperformed OpenSSL in almost every category | ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-rust-based-tls-library-outperformed-openssl-in-almost-every-category/ "A Rust-based TLS library outperformed OpenSSL in almost every category | ZDNet") — The findings are the result of a recent four-part series of benchmarks carried out by Joseph Birr-Pixton, the developer behind the Rustls library.
  * [TLS performance: rustls versus OpenSSL](https://jbp.io/2019/07/01/rustls-vs-openssl-performance.html "TLS performance: rustls versus OpenSSL") — A TLS library will represent separate sessions in memory while they are in use. How much memory these sessions use will dictate how many sessions can be concurrently terminated on a given server. 
  * [Nat Friedman on Twitter](https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1155311124687945728 "Nat Friedman on Twitter") — Users with restricted private repos can also choose to make them public. Our understanding of the law does not give us the option to give anyone advance notice of restrictions.
