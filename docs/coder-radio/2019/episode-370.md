  * [Emacs Feedback from DJ](https://slexy.org/view/s21tBxvKkN "Emacs Feedback from DJ") — Another point for the show is a soft intro to functional programming. Wes mentioned Emacs because of the packages supporting Clojure development when he started with that. Elisp seems to be fairly intuitive and well documented, as a little functional language its own right (correct me if I'm wrong)--this makes for a soft intro to FP. Most of my coding has been in the space of embedded systems and low-level languages--not much functional programming to be had. This show has gotten me curious about FP, which is quite old in concept, and getting implemented nicely in modern languages. For me, I still rely heavily on special Vim keys that are not mapped in evil-mode, which causes some paper cuts. However, elisp makes it easy to customize the desired UI functionality with very short programs/elisp statements in a config file. It's quite a refreshing exercise for someone like me.

Artichoke provides a Ruby runtime implemented in Rust that can be loaded into many VM backends. 
  * [AP Sources: Boeing changing Max software to use 2 computers](https://news.yahoo.com/ap-sources-boeing-changing-max-184231846.html "AP Sources: Boeing changing Max software to use 2 computers") — Boeing is working on new software for the 737 Max that will use a second flight control computer to make the system more reliable, solving a problem that surfaced in June with the grounded jet, two people briefed on the matter said Friday. 
  * [In Pentagon Contract Fight, Amazon Has Foes in High Places - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/us/politics/amazon-pentagon-contract-trump.html "In Pentagon Contract Fight, Amazon Has Foes in High Places - The New York Times") — Experts thought the contract for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, known by the cinematic acronym JEDI, would go to Amazon Web Services, the dominant player in the field of cloud computing. They did not count on two developments: an extraordinarily aggressive public relations and lobbying campaign by Oracle, one of Amazon’s competitors, and the hostility of Mr. Trump to Amazon and its founder, Jeff Bezos.

  * [The Problem With F# Evangelism](https://thomasbandt.com/the-problem-with-fsharp-evangelism "The Problem With F# Evangelism") — There seems to be a constant struggle to convince seasoned C# developers to give F# a try. Which is a pity because language and concepts deserve better.
