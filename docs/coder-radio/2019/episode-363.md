  * [Kotlin overview](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/overview "Kotlin overview") — Kotlin is an open-source, statically-typed programming language that supports both object-oriented and functional programming. Kotlin provides similar syntax and concepts from other languages, including C#, Java, and Scala, among many others. Kotlin does not aim to be unique—instead, it draws inspiration from decades of language development. It exists in variants that target the JVM (Kotlin/JVM), JavaScript (Kotlin/JS), and native code (Kotlin/Native).
  * [Kotlin/Native](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/native-overview.html "Kotlin/Native") — Kotlin/Native is a technology for compiling Kotlin code to native binaries, which can run without a virtual machine. It is an LLVM based backend for the Kotlin compiler and native implementation of the Kotlin standard library. 
  * [Kotlin for JavaScript](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/js-overview.html "Kotlin for JavaScript") — Kotlin provides the ability to target JavaScript. It does so by transpiling Kotlin to JavaScript. The current implementation targets ECMAScript 5.1 but there are plans to eventually target ECMAScript 2015 as well. 
  * [My favorite examples of functional programming in Kotlin](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/my-favorite-examples-of-functional-programming-in-kotlin-e69217b39112/ "My favorite examples of functional programming in Kotlin") — One of the great things about Kotlin is that it supports functional programming. Let’s see and discuss some simple but expressive functions written in Kotlin. 
  * [Arrow: Functional companion to Kotlin's Standard Library](https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow "Arrow: Functional companion to Kotlin's Standard Library") — Arrow aims to provide a lingua franca of interfaces and abstractions across Kotlin libraries. For this, it includes the most popular data types, type classes and abstractions such as Option, Try, Either, IO, Functor, Applicative, Monad to empower users to write pure FP apps and libraries built atop higher order abstractions.

  * [Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian Warns Always-On Work Culture Creating ‘Broken’ People - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/always-on-work-culture-creating-broken-people-says-reddit-co-founder-11558464608?emailToken=jdd1ded3fe95869f59c5064798e65ebf9Qybo8bj7riCxdIw1YGIITt7wIyxoaHHjHSfqIgonrPQCMH4GjO6ZN3Zk39NMwg0tpJpQ6VU8z1DQBHRg0upYAPHE4WScMoyTlvx7WNmmafbO3zRzcZ9nKYtcs5GbJA3NKtdkVyXAILqTWZuoi4%20zjQ== "Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian Warns Always-On Work Culture Creating ‘Broken’ People - WSJ") — “I’ve spoken out quite a bit about things like ‘hustle porn,’ and this ceremony of showing off on social [media] about how hard you’re working,” said Mr. Ohanian, who previously co-founded online discussion forum Reddit. “Y’all see it on Instagram and you certainly see it in the startup community, and it becomes really toxic.”
  * [Thread by @mwseibel](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1142534180594573312.html "Thread by @mwseibel") — I’ve noticed that many people compete in games they don’t understand because they are modeling the behavior of people around them. Most common is the competition for wealth as a proxy for happiness.
  * [Understanding Burnout Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/jupiterbroadcasting/events/261839605/ "Understanding Burnout Meetup") — You may not know it yet, but IT is not easy. Breakdowns in people, processes, and technology leads to frustrating times for all of us. As it spirals out of control, we often meet the final boss: burnout.
