## About this episode

As Python 2's demise draws near we reflect on Python's popularity, the growing adoption of static typing, and why the Python 3 transition took so long.

Plus Apple's audacious app store tactics, Google's troubles with Typescript, and more!

  * [Feedback: What about Perl 6?](https://slexy.org/view/s2GMa363ln "Feedback: What about Perl 6?") — Last episode (373) that's on about shell scripting, interpreted languages, repl & cli, made me think about Perl 6.
  * [Feedback: Pry and a Pick](https://slexy.org/view/s2sHl0j5xl "Feedback: Pry and a Pick") — In the previous episode I was amazed to hear that Mike had never used pry before! It's one of the first things I show off to people when introducing them to Ruby.
  * [Feedback: Learning Web Dev](https://slexy.org/view/s20RoYjNmV "Feedback: Learning Web Dev") — I feel woefully unready and I was wondering if either of you had suggestions for structured content around web dev/design that I could use to augment my learning? I've been using Pluralsight, which is great, and I'd be curious to know what else you might suggest. 
  * [Google feedback on TypeScript 3.5](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/33272 "Google feedback on TypeScript 3.5") — We know and expect every TypeScript upgrade to involve some work. For example, improvements to the standard library are expected and welcomed by us, even though they may mean removing similar but incompatible definitions from our own code base. However, TypeScript 3.5 was a lot more work for us than other recent TypeScript upgrades.

  * [Sunsetting Python 2 | Python.org](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/ "Sunsetting Python 2 | Python.org") — We have decided that January 1, 2020, will be the day that we sunset Python 2. That means that we will not improve it anymore after that day, even if someone finds a security problem in it. You should upgrade to Python 3 as soon as you can.

It’s our most widely used language both for backend services and the desktop client app (we are also heavy users of Go, TypeScript, and Rust). At our scale—millions of lines of Python—the dynamic typing in Python made code needlessly hard to understand and started to seriously impact productivity. T
