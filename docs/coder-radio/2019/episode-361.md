  * [Feedback: Lance’s FOSS Quandary](https://pastebin.com/C5AYBD0i "Feedback: Lance’s FOSS Quandary") — I was working on an open source project for school that we (4 members) submitted. Myself and another did 98% of the work the others contributed to the documentation (outside of the codebase). Class is over now for many months and nobody has touched the code but one other member and I wish to keep it going.
  * [Feedback: Developer, have money for a new Mac Pro? Buy these instead.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoderRadio/comments/bxxq8f/developers_have_money_for_a_new_mac_pro_buy_these/ "Feedback: Developer, have money for a new Mac Pro? Buy these instead.") — The recently unveiled Mac Pro is no doubt a gorgeous machine, engineered for a very particular group of people. While it will likely be a great machine for those who live and breathe within Finalcut and work with ProRes files, it’s overkill for a good developer machine.
  * [Apple makes fancy zsh default in forthcoming macOS 'Catalina'](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/06/04/apple_zsh_macos_catalina_default/ "Apple makes fancy zsh default in forthcoming macOS 'Catalina'") — "zsh is highly compatible with the Bourne shell (sh) and mostly compatible with bash, with some differences," Apple explained in a support document posted on Monday in conjunction with the announcement of macOS Catalina, which ships this fall. 
  * [Oh My Zsh - a delightful & open source framework for Z-Shell](https://ohmyz.sh/ "Oh My Zsh - a delightful & open source framework for Z-Shell") — Oh My Zsh is a delightful, open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration. It comes bundled with thousands of helpful functions, helpers, plugins, themes, and a few things that make you shout... “Oh My ZSH!”

  * [Mike's Blog: Converting to SwiftUI Steps[0]](http://dominickm.com/converting-swiftui-steps0/ "Mike's Blog: Converting to SwiftUI Steps\[0\]") — SwiftUI is the next paradigm in iOS and macOS user interface development. However, if you’re like me you already have Xcode projects that are using the now legacy storyboard technology. Luckily, it possible to update your existing projects to use SwiftUI and the process is very straightforward.
  * [Mike's Blog: Converting to SwiftUI Steps[1]](http://dominickm.com/converting-swiftui-steps1/ "Mike's Blog: Converting to SwiftUI Steps\[1\]") — Continuing my journey into SwiftUI, I am taking a look at re-using existing UIViews and UIViewControllers in SwiftUI. The primary advantage here is not having to rewrite your existing code from scratch, however, it’s probably best to create any new views in SwiftUI directly rather than UIView. 
  * [SwiftUI for React Native Developers](https://medium.com/@rorogadget/swiftui-for-react-native-developers-2072a21c22fb "SwiftUI for React Native Developers") — Developers with React Native experience may notice some similarities to the philosophies Apple has imbued into their new UI framework. Utilizing structs as immutable value types for view modeling, a declarative syntax, and with their new async event library Combine, a reactive architecture.
  * [SwiftUI - Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/ "SwiftUI - Apple Developer") — SwiftUI is an innovative, exceptionally simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift.
