  * [rbenv: Groom your app’s Ruby environment](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv "rbenv: Groom your app’s Ruby environment") — Use rbenv to pick a Ruby version for your application and guarantee that your development environment matches production. Put rbenv to work with Bundler for painless Ruby upgrades and bulletproof deployments. 
  * [Serverless Feedback from TomEnom](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoderRadio/comments/av1j2t/serverless_squabbles_coder_radio_346/ehhy77p/ "Serverless Feedback from TomEnom") — One thing you left out of your definition of serverless (IMO) that I find important is that it scales to zero. So if your lambda/function is not being used it incurs zero cost. I guess you could say that that is where serverless becomes literal.
  * [Install openSUSE on Digital Ocean](http://dominickm.com/install-opensuse-digital-ocean/ "Install openSUSE on Digital Ocean") — Unfortunately, Digital does not at present have an option for an openSUSE image. That doesn’t mean that you can’t use openSUSE on Digital Ocean, but it is going to be a little more work than most common Linux distributions.
  * [What is Pika?](https://www.pikapkg.com/about "What is Pika?") — Pika's mission is to make modern JavaScript more accessible by making it easier to find, publish, install, and use modern packages on npm. 
  * [Introducing: pika/pack](https://www.pikapkg.com/blog/introducing-pika-pack/ "Introducing: pika/pack") — If you’ve recently published a package to npm, you know how much work goes into a modern build process. Transpile JavaScript, compile TypeScript, convert ES Module syntax (ESM) to Common.js, configure your package.json manifest… and that’s just the basics.
