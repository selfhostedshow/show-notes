It had served Google the two-year-old startup, and had now scaled to support Google the public company. In fact, around that time, a lucky Google engineer had just snagged PR #20,000,000. Still chugging along, the server was now executing ‚Äú11-12 million commands‚Äù a day.

  * [Why you shouldn't use AI to write your tests](https://swizec.com/blog/why-you-shouldnt-use-ai-to-write-your-tests/ "Why you shouldn't use AI to write your tests") ‚Äî People are starting to use AI to write their tests. This is great! Also very bad.
  * [We created the first open-source implementation of Meta‚Äôs TestGen‚ÄìLLM](https://www.codium.ai/blog/we-created-the-first-open-source-implementation-of-metas-testgen-llm/ "We created the first open-source implementation of Meta‚Äôs TestGen‚ÄìLLM") ‚Äî In February, Meta researchers published a paper titled Automated Unit Test Improvement using Large Language Models at Meta, which introduces a tool they called TestGen-LLM. The fully automated approach to increasing test coverage ‚Äúwith guaranteed assurances for improvement over the existing code base‚Äù created waves in the software engineering world.

If you want to know why (and more), ask a treasury secretary, an economic diplomat, a director of the National Economic Council and the president of Harvard. Larry Summers has been all of those things (and more).
  * [Apple‚Äôs Longer-Lasting Devices, iOS 19 and Apple Intelligence on the Vision Pro ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-30/apple-s-longer-lasting-devices-ios-19-and-apple-intelligence-on-the-vision-pro-ly1jnrw4 "Apple‚Äôs Longer-Lasting Devices, iOS 19 and Apple Intelligence on the Vision Pro ") ‚Äî Apple‚Äôs strategy to make its devices last longer will mean AI and software are even more important to its business.
  * [Apple may charge ‚Äúmonthly fees‚Äù for advanced Apple Intelligence features](https://www.dexerto.com/tech/apple-may-charge-monthly-fees-for-advanced-apple-intelligence-features-2803334/ "Apple may charge ‚Äúmonthly fees‚Äù for advanced Apple Intelligence features") ‚Äî ‚ÄúThough Apple Intelligence will be free to start, the long-term plan is to make money off the capabilities,‚Äù said the report. ‚ÄúThe company could eventually launch something like Apple Intelligence+ ‚Äî with extra features that users pay monthly fees for, just like iCloud,‚Äù it added.
  * [Apple Intelligence coming to Vision Pro headset, some features could eventually be paid ](https://www.financialexpress.com/life/technology-apple-intelligence-coming-to-vision-pro-headset-some-features-could-eventually-be-paid-3540671/ "Apple Intelligence coming to Vision Pro headset, some features could eventually be paid ") ‚Äî Gurman says that Apple is facing slower hardware upgrades which is why it‚Äôs banking more on service fees and subscriptions for growth

Apple already takes a cut of subscription revenue from any AI partner it brings on board. "The company will be less reliant on hardware tweaks to drive its business and will actually be making money from AI ‚Äî something everyone in Silicon Valley is hoping to pull off," Gurman says.
