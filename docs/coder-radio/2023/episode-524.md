Though like visionOS Safari, some of these browsers have kept the feature as a developer preview for now.
  * [Omni Group Apps Coming to üçèVision Pro](https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/omni-roadmap-2023-post-wwdc-update "Omni Group Apps Coming to üçèVision Pro") ‚Äî Now, we don‚Äôt expect this first generation Vision Pro to be adopted by everyone, any more than first generations of Apple‚Äôs other platforms‚Äîthe Apple II, 128K Mac, iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch‚Äîwere adopted by everyone.

Eddy‚Äôs more progressive, Joz is more progressive, and we know Matt is as well. Phil just needs to get his meaty paws off the App Store.‚Äù
  * [Why did the #TwitterMigration fail? ](https://blog.bloonface.com/2023/06/12/why-did-the-twittermigration-fail/ "Why did the #TwitterMigration fail? ") ‚Äî I have evidence of this. I recently shut down my Mastodon instance that I started in November, mastodon.bloonface.com, and (as is proper) it sent out about 700,000 kill messages to inform other instances that it had federated with that it was going offline for good, and to delete all record of it from their databases. Around 25% of these were returned undelivered because the instances had simply dropped offline.
  * [Daring Fireball: Why Has Mastodon Adoption Stalled?](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/23/bloonface-twitter-migration "Daring Fireball: Why Has Mastodon Adoption Stalled?") ‚Äî After Elon Musk took the helm at Twitter there was an initial burst of new users and increased usage on Mastodon (and the rest of the Fediverse, but mostly this is about Mastodon as an alternative to Twitter). And then it flattened, and perhaps has even declined. I would like to see Mastodon thrive. But the platform‚Äôs ideological zealotry is obviously holding it back and seemingly isn‚Äôt going to change.
