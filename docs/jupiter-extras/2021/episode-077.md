## About this episode

Taken from Monday's Coder live stream, Chris reacts to discovering that the city of Miami has its own crypto coin. As the conversation goes on it turns into a broader discussion about how cryptocurrency gets a bad reputation, and why that reputation is completely divorced from the reality of the technology.
