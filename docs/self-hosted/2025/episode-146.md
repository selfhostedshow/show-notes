I call it Anubis. Anubis weighs the soul of your connection using a sha256 proof-of-work challenge in order to protect upstream resources from scraper bots. It's a reverse proxy that requires browsers and bots to solve a proof-of-work challenge before they can access your site, just like Hashcash.
  * [Building native packages is complicated - Xe Iaso](https://xeiaso.net/blog/2025/anubis-packaging/ "Building native packages is complicated - Xe Iaso") ‚Äî Normally when I make projects, I don't expect them to take off. I especially don't expect to front page news on Ars Technica and TechCrunch within the span of a few days. I very much also do not expect to say sentences like "FFmpeg uses a program I made to help them stop scraper bots taking down their issue tracker". The last week has been fairly ridiculous in that regard.

Git servers host FOSS projects so that anyone who wants can download the code or contribute to it.
