  * [Docker is deleting Open Source organisations](https://blog.alexellis.io/docker-is-deleting-open-source-images/ "Docker is deleting Open Source organisations") — Yesterday, Docker sent an email to any Docker Hub user who had created an "organisation", telling them their account will be deleted including all images, if they do not upgrade to a paid team plan. The email contained a link to a tersely written PDF (since, silently edited) which was missing many important details which caused significant anxiety and additional work for open source maintainers.

  * [/etc/subuid and /etc/subgid configuration](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md#etcsubuid-and-etcsubgid-configuration "/etc/subuid and /etc/subgid configuration") — Rootless Podman requires the user running it to have a range of UIDs listed in the files /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid. 
  * [Using volumes with Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/rootless_tutorial.md#using-volumes "Using volumes with Podman") — If your container runs with the root user, then root in the container is actually your user on the host. UID/GID 1 is the first UID/GID specified in your user's mapping in /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid, etc. If you mount a directory from the host into a container as a rootless user, and create a file in that directory as root in the container, you'll see it's actually owned by your user on the host.

  * [Remove not supported column comments for SQLite - Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/36803 "Remove not supported column comments for SQLite - Nextcloud") — Some times column comments are used, e.g. to make clear an integer is used as a timestamp. For SQLite column comments are not supported and migration that use column comments will not work (see linked comment above for an example). Somehow it works when you have a clean install, then all migrations pass, but when executing single migrations they will fail.
