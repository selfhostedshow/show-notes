It's been one of those minor friction points of network administration that I've put up with because automating the process seemed daunting. This post will detail how I solved a few interesting problems as I fully automated DNS overrides and DHCP reservations using Pihole, and the program it's built on top of Dnsmasq.
  * [Cluster Manager - Proxmox VE](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Cluster_Manager "Cluster Manager - Proxmox VE") — The Proxmox VE cluster manager pvecm is a tool to create a group of physical servers. Such a group is called a cluster. We use the Corosync Cluster Engine for reliable group communication. There’s no explicit limit for the number of nodes in a cluster. In practice, the actual possible node count may be limited by the host and network performance. Currently (2021), there are reports of clusters (using high-end enterprise hardware) with over 50 nodes in production.
