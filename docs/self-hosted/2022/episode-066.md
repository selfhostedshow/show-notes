  * [10 years of Raspberry Pi - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiwm5TMHIy8 "10 years of Raspberry Pi - YouTube") — Almost exactly ten years ago today, thousands of you set your alarms, and woke on leap-day morning to discover that we’d started selling Raspberry Pi computers. By the time our all-volunteer team gathered in the pub that evening for celebratory drinks, our licensees Farnell and RS Components had taken over 100,000 orders (despite struggling to keep their websites online under the load); we had (briefly) out-trended Lady Gaga; and Raspberry Pi was on the road to becoming a little larger than we’d planned.
  * [Too expensive to run in the UK now?!](https://old.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/t8u3x7/too_expensive_to_run_in_the_uk_now/ "Too expensive to run in the UK now?!") — My server uses 136 watts, and will costs £1.80 a day to run from June when the price increases kick in costing £54 a month. I'm starting to think maybe it's not worth it anymore having it run all the time! Is anyone else re-thinking their home servers given the current cost situation?

They run Linux, and you can do just about anything with them: people build robots, they learn to code, they run media servers.
