  * [Shelly Sensors Guide: Humidity and Temperature](https://www.facebook.com/legacy/notes/212734947049197/ "Shelly Sensors Guide: Humidity and Temperature") — Connecting to WiFi and performing other computations causes the internal temperature of the H&T to rise. All electronic devices generate a little bit of heat, so this fact is unavoidable. The small size of the H&T intensifies this challenge. The part of the H&T that takes temperature measurements is close by and confined within the same case that houses the heat-generating components like the CPU. Shelly engineers devised a way to get around the problem by having the device sleep, then quickly take a measurement before the locally-produced heat can skew the measurement.
