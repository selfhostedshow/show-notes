  * [VZW TTL Trick Alex Found on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/8p69ez/bypassing_verizons_unlimited_plans/ "VZW TTL Trick Alex Found on Reddit") — By default, Android and iOS (probably) have IP TTL's of 64. The ISPs can use this knowledge to decide whether or not a packet originated from the Android device or if it was only routed through the Android device. For example, Linux distributions typically have a default TTL of 64. 
  * [FileRun - File Manager](http://www.filerun.com/ "FileRun - File Manager") — Just like you do with an FTP server, point FileRun to where you keep the files on your server and you will get instant web access to them.

Wouldn't it be nice if we could slice up 1 GPU and use it with multiple VMs at once?
