You Can Download Them Free") — Prior to 1964, books had a 28-year copyright term. Extending it required authors or publishers to send in a separate form, and lots of people didn't end up doing that. Thanks to the efforts of the New York Public Library, many of those public domain books are now free online.

The engineers involved have been implementing enough of the EFI Boot Services to be able to kexec Windows from Linux. 
  * [Roy Hopkins on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rd_hopkins/status/1154888315092557824 "Roy Hopkins on Twitter") — That's a coincidence.
