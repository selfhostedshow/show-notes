  * [Jim Kopps on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JimKopps/status/1135684113447436288 "Jim Kopps on Twitter") — I would be interested in @ChrisLAS and the Jupiter crew's opinion of this. For the record, it has been my opinion since the first "year of the Linux desktop" what seems like fifty years ago: "The current situation with dozens of distributions, each with different rules, each with different versions of different libraries, some with certain libraries missing, each with different packaging tools and packaging formats ... that basically tells app developers "go away, focus on platforms that care about applications."

The plan was to rendezvous at Hard Eights BBQ from 6:30 to 8:00. Since we had to make a five-hour journey it had us arriving a little later to the meetup. As soon as we pulled into the parking lot that smell of slow-smoked Texas BBQ slapped me right in the face, and I knew I had arrived; Google did not even have to tell me.
