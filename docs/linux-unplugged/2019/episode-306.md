While WSL2 has improved the I/O performance thanks to the new Hyper-V-based virtualization approach employed by WSL2, the performance has regressed in other areas for running Linux binaries on Windows 10.
  * [The Future of Docker Desktop for Windows - Docker Engineering Blog](https://engineering.docker.com/2019/06/docker-hearts-wsl-2/ "The Future of Docker Desktop for Windows - Docker Engineering Blog") — ith WSL 2 integration, you will still experience the same seamless integration with Windows, but Linux programs running inside WSL will also be able to do the same. This has a huge impact for developers working on projects targeting a Linux environment, or with a build process tailored for Linux. No need for maintaining both Linux and Windows build scripts anymore! As an example, a developer at Docker can now work on the Linux Docker daemon on Windows, using the same set of tools and scripts as a developer on a Linux machine

  * [Fedora · zfsonlinux/zfs Wiki](https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/wiki/Fedora "Fedora · zfsonlinux/zfs Wiki") — Only DKMS style packages can be provided for Fedora from the official zfsonlinux.org repository. This is because Fedora is a fast moving distribution which does not provide a stable kABI. These packages track the official ZFS on Linux tags and are updated as new versions are released.

  * [Sharing ZFS Datasets Via NFS | Programster's Blog](https://blog.programster.org/sharing-zfs-datasets-via-nfs "Sharing ZFS Datasets Via NFS | Programster's Blog") — The great thing about ZFS is that it is very easy to split your "pool" into as many datasets as you like. Each dataset is treated like its own filesystem, with its own rules and settings, which means with regards to sharing over NFS, that you can share more securely as client's will not be able to reach out of the bounds of that dataset/filesystem that you decided to share.
  * [How to easily configure WireGuard - Stavros' Stuff](https://www.stavros.io/posts/how-to-configure-wireguard/ "How to easily configure WireGuard - Stavros' Stuff") — At its core, all WireGuard does is create an interface from one computer to another. It doesn’t really let you access other computers on either end of the network, or forward all your traffic through the VPN server, or anything like that. It just connects two computers, directly, quickly and securely.

An alternative to password authentication is public key authentication, in which you generate and store on your computer a pair of cryptographic keys and then configure your server to recognize and accept your keys
