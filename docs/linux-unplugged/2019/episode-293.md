Suse was first acquired by Novell in 2004. Novell was then acquired by Attachmate in 2010, which Micro Focus acquired in 2014. The company then turned Suse into an independent division, only to then announce its sale to EQT in the middle of 2018.

What if you want to do more than just logging calls, e.g. you want to compile statistics on certain behavior? What if you want to trace multiple processes and correlate data from multiple sources? In 2019, there's finally a decent answer to that on Linux: bpftrace, based on eBPF technology.
  * [Learn eBPF Tracing: Tutorial and Examples](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2019-01-01/learn-ebpf-tracing.html "Learn eBPF Tracing: Tutorial and Examples") — eBPF can be used for many things: network performance, firewalls, security, tracing, device drivers, and more!
  * [IO Visor Project](https://www.iovisor.org/ "IO Visor Project") — The IO Visor Project is an open source project and a community of developers to accelerate the innovation, development, and sharing of virtualized in-kernel IO services for tracing, analytics, monitoring, security and networking functions. It builds on the Linux community to bring open, flexible, distributed, secure and easy to operate technologies that enable any stack to run efficiently on any physical infrastructure.
