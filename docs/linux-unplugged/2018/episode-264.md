We needed an internal codename we could use that wouldn't tip our hand if it leaked (so Wine puns are out), and that we wouldn't be embarrassed to continue using after release (sorry, BadgerBadgerBadger). A bunch of ideas were tossed around the CodeWeavers office one afternoon, and I ended up picking Proton because it's short, easy to remember, sounds cool, and is hard to Google for. Although, I like your explanation too :)
