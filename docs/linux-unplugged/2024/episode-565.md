  * [Linux May Be the Best Way to Avoid the AI Nightmare](https://www.lifewire.com/install-linux-avoid-ai-8655664 "Linux May Be the Best Way to Avoid the AI Nightmare") â€” What if you care about AI's environmental impact, privacy holes, and the ethical problems of training on data without the creators' permission? The answer might be to switch to Linux. Yes, Linux.
  * [Kate Asks about Mistakes to Avoid](https://paste.docs.lol/reader/TatterIcelanders "Kate Asks about Mistakes to Avoid") â€” Hey boys-Microsoft has officially gone off the deep end with this AI stuff. I'm pretty sure AI Clippy is pulling the strings behind the scenes. Any tips for escaping to Linux before I get assimilated? What are the big don'ts for a newbie?
  * [Jeremy Molina on X](https://x.com/jeremymolina/status/1796595527108468849 "Jeremy Molina on X") â€” sudo rm -rf ./ on the root directory ðŸ˜“
  * [Lee Ball on X](https://x.com/lee_ball/status/1797260554513342701 "Lee Ball on X") â€” I thought I was in a backup directory when I did an rm -rf but turned out I'd forgotten the ./ and just went into /var/lib/mysql and not the backup of said directory.
  * [ChaoticHuman on X](https://x.com/_ChaoticHuman/status/1796631702736863502 "ChaoticHuman on X") â€” I think my most major beginner mistake once was something like sudochownuseraccount/ because I wanted to not have to deal with file-ownership-conflicts though I no longer remember what exactly I did. I only remember that it led to completely destroying my Linux-system.
  * [Ken Starks on X](https://x.com/Reglue/status/1796755606227112154 "Ken Starks on X") â€” What are all these files with a dot before them. They aren't programs. Might as well delete them.
  * [PDunn on X](https://x.com/pwdunn/status/1796638182697521625 "PDunn on X") â€” Using fringe distos and too much distrohopping causing loss of time and not being productive. Linux can be a time sink I don't have time for. So I installed Ubuntu and moved on. I just use what works and is easy to maintain. Unplugged contributor here.

It does not require any prior Nix knowledge, and instead builds up the Flake based world from first principles, so that it can serve as an introduction to Nix itself, as well as the concept and uses of Flakes.
