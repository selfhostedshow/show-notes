He has a resonsibility as someone managing a huge project to enforce rules as he sees best, while I have a responsibility to support users with working code, and to do that to the best of my abilities.

I've created a simple module for spinning up a podman container running pihole as a systemd service, so that way I can just stick it on any NixOS machine and easily make it my DNS server.
