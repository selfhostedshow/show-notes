We've turned our development model into a well-oiled engineering marvel creating something that no one else has ever been able to accomplish. Adding another language really shouldn't be a problem, we've handled much worse things in the past and we shouldn't give up now on wanting to ensure that our project succeeds for the next 20+ years. We've got to keep pushing forward when confronted with new good ideas, and embrace the people offering to join us in actually doing the work to help make sure that we all succeed together.
  * [Kees Cook on Rust in the kernel](https://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/2025021954-flaccid-pucker-f7d9@gregkh/ "Kees Cook on Rust in the kernel") ‚Äî In other words, I don't see any reason to focus on replacing existing code -- doing so would actually carry a lot of risk. But writing new stuff in Rust is very effective. Old code is more stable and has fewer bugs already, and yet, we're still going to continue the work of hardening C, because we still need to shake those bugs out. But new code can be written in Rust, and not have any of these classes of bugs at all from day one.

You can ignore it. But "ignore the Rust side" automatically also means that you don't have any say on the Rust side.
